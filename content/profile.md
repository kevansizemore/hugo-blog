## A Brief Introduction

I consider myself ordinary, someone easy to miss in a crowd. I'm usually pretty quiet; when I talk, I try to say something worth hearing. I try to live simply and in most cases, reasonably. Faced with contention, I tend to continue being "a nice guy" even when it's self-detrimental. Each day, I strive to make the most of the time, talents, relationships, and opportunities God has graciously provided.

My interests include archery, collecting, cooking, education, gaming, illustration, music, photography, programming, radio control & railroad modeling, reading, shooting, technology, theology, tinkering in my workshop, and writing. I'm not interested in most television shows or sports. For recreation, I enjoy cycling, hiking, and fishing. Some of my best memories involve meaningful time and experiences shared with family and friends.

## Around the Internet

Searching for me on [Google](https://www.google.com/search?as_epq=kevan+sizemore) or [Bing](https://www.bing.com/search?q=%2bkevan+sizemore) yields mixed results at best. There are plenty of people with similar names and a plethora of services that offer to sell information about me. I avoid most popular [(anti)social networks](https://kevansizemore.com/blog/2020/08/01/quitting-antisocial-media/) like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, ~~Twitter~~ X, and the like. 

For your convenience, I have listed my "official" online personas below. If you find a persona or profile on a social network or elsewhere on the Internet that looks like me, consider it with skepticism and suspicion. It's not something I authorized or created and it may be inaccurate or incomplete.
