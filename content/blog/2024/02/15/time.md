Ready or not.<br />
It arrives.<br />
It departs.<br />
Without regard.

By second or minute.<br /> 
By hour or by day.<br />
Counted any way,<br />
it passes always. 

It seems to fly,<br />
to crawl, or stand still.<br />
Yet each moment comes<br />
and it goes just the same.

It cannot be stored.<br />
Nor can it be bought.<br />
We pass through it once.<br />
Wisely savor your only shot.
