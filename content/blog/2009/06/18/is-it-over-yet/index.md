Should be wrapping up college this week.  This semester, I learned that I was never intended to be a physicist and math hates me.  Perhaps some intensive therapy will help me get over it...  I plan to tackle some updates to my personal web site, social networks and spend some quality time on WoW and Xbox Live.  It will be good to play with my long lost friends again!
