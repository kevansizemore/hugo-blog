Been taking a break from WoW for the past week or so. I've been neglecting some projects IRL that require some "offline time" to care for. I do plan to spend quite a bit of time on Independence Day raiding with a new guild on Stormreaver and hanging out with friends on Kalecgos. Of course, I'll also fire up the grill and have some traditional cookout-type foods as well.  Should make for a nice day of food and fun with friends.  

For what it's worth - I think everyone needs a break from WoW every now and again.  Kinda helps bring other things into focus and serves as a great reminder that WoW, much like every other game, is best enjoyed as a form of recreation, not as a profession.
