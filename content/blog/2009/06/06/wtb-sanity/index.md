I suppose it's easy to lose track of time when you're having fun - or when you're completely overwhelmed with the likes of work and school. The good news is that I only have 2 weeks left in this semester.

So what's new with my gamer life...

I dumped my Sony subscription to EQII / Vanguard. They're fun games, however I've come to the conclusion that I will never experience all the content WoW has to offer, nor will I fully develop my characters unless I choose a single game to focus on. Of all the MMO games I've played, most of my time is invested in WoW and given all the new content added in the WotLK expansion, I don't forsee running out of things to do.

So there you have it - it's either WoW or Xbox Live for me.

So what's going on with my WoW toons?

My death knight hit level 80. (Woot!) I deleted my 72 gnome mage. This may sound sad, but I think the world is a much better place with one less gnome running around. I've also been focused on leveling secondary professions on some of my older characters lately - shooting for the "Skills to Pay the Bills" achievement.

Speaking of professions - I also ditched some crafting professions and leveled up gathering professions instead. I find that this far better in terms of generating a sustained income given the amount of time and energy I devote to playing. I only kept four crafting professions: enchanting (disenchanting?), alchemy (for my priest potions), engineering (epic motorcycle), and lastly tailoring (flying carpet).

Well, that's all for now. Happy Hunting!
