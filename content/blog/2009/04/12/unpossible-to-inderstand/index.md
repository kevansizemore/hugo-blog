Played my orc shaman today for a little while and leveled him to 41. I enjoy a dual-wield spec shaman with macesâ€š especially when Windfury and Flurry proc at the same time.

Ran my death knight last knight with a couple friend and knocked down some quests while I was at it. Also ran across the same night-elf hunter about 5-6 times; harassing players of the opposing faction always makes me happy.

In an unrelated story, I renamed two characters on the Stormreaver realm; my Tauren hunter is now known as "Rhostbeef" and my rogue, "Dorkfish." I will update my character profile links accordingly some time this weekend.
