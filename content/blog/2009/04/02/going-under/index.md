Haven't been able to play as much as I would like this weekâ€š in fact tonight is the first chance I've had to devote a bit of time to gaming. Played my troll hunter for a while in Howling Fjord doing some of the starter quests. Got about 3-4 bars into 69; may work on getting him to 70 this weekend.

I also checked the mail across all my characters; turns out I had a little over 100g worth of auction sales that I hadn't collected yet. =)

Enough fun for one night; ciao!
