Usually Mondays are a great day for me but this one just seemed to be a drain from start to finish. In the plus columnâ€š got my mage to level 72. When he's buffed his critical hit rate is over 50% which makes me happy. Also respecced him to purely arcane.  

Hopefully things will be better tomorrow and maintenance/patch day won't bring down the servers. Again.
