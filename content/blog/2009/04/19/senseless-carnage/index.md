Got quite a bit done in terms of gaming today. Leveled up my warrior to 73, ran Mana-Tombs with my priest, and 4-manned Sethekk Halls & Auchenai Crypts with some of my good friends from Virginia. Been a long time since I played until the early morning hours‚ but I must say it was tons of fun and a great way to unwind after a busy week.

In an unrelated story‚ I finally updated my web site so that all my character names are correct and link to the appropriate profiles. Even my Xbox Live gamer card is updated. Woot!

Until next time...
