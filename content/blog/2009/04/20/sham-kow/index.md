What a weekend! I cannot remember the last time I logged so many hours in two days. Leveled up my shaman & druid today and also fixed a problem I was having with my talent points not showing up correctly. For those interested, here are the directions I posted on the Blizzard Technical Support forums:

### Possible Fix

Here goes... it's not pretty, it will cost you some gold, but it worked for me. :)

**Step 1: Reset Your Interface.** With the game closed please try moving or deleting your WTF, CACHE, and INTERFACE folders out of your World of Warcraft directory. These are temporary cache files that will be recreated by the game the next time you launch. Moving them to the desktop makes it easy to replace them if necessary.

*Please also note these folders contain your saved macros and UI addons. By moving or deleting these folders you will also remove any saved preferences, UI addons, or macros you may have added.*

**Step 2: Unlearn Current Talents.** Go to your trainer and pay the cost to 'unlearn' your current talent spec (which you cannot see / determine).

**Step 3: Respec Your Character.** Spend your talent points and then logout / login to see if the settings were retained.

**Step 4: Reinstall Mods.** This latest patch made quite a few changes to the API for mods - if your mod has not been updated specifically for Patch 3.1 then you may not want to use it. I would also suggest installing one mod at a time just in case a particular combination of mods is causing this issue or conflicting with Blizzard's interface elements.

That's it! It worked for me - hopefully this will help resolve your talent issues as well.
