Leveled my troll hunter from 69 to 70 in a single session tonight and I'm exhausted. But, I had a great time and managed to get my first horde character to 70 as well. I got some training and purchased a few new pieces of gear to celebrate. Enjoying the horde quest line in Northrend so far; the story is engaging and the soundtrack is pretty nice too.

Until next time...
