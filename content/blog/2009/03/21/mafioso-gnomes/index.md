Played my horde PvP toons tonight. Good news: I leveled up my hunter. Bad news: got camped and ganked by some annoying alliance players. So I'm calling it a night. On an unrelated note, I played my dwarf priest earlier and had a flawless run of Mana Tombs. Even got some nice boots that dropped.

Good night everybody.
