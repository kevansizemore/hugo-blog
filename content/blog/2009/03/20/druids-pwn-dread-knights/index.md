So I got bored with the Dread Knight in Vanguard... and decided to play a Druid instead. LOVED IT!!! I played him for a little over an hour or so; still enjoying the root/nuke spell combo. It just never gets old; I can see myself playing this character pretty regularly when I get bored with WoW.

Speaking of WoW‚ I did manage to ding 63 tonight. Made a trip to the auction house and bought a couple pieces of gear as a reward to myself.

Until next time‚ everything in moderation.
