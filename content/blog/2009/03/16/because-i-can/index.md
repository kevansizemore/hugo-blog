So I'm sitting in my "man-cave" (as my beloved wife describes it) when it occurs to me that there simply aren't enough blogs on the web. While I have a blog which is devoted to sharing life lessons and other themes of substance, I thought it might be fun to have a blog where I can give a "play-by-play" recap of all the time I waste playing MMO games or Xbox Live.

Enter the **Beazst Board**. Don't expect top-notch writing or anything significant. In fact, this is all about me, not you. It's my own pathetic way of remembering what adventures I have online, with whom, and when.

Perhaps I shall print these all out one day and publish them as an electronic book entitled "How I Wasted My Life" or something along those lines.

In the mean timeâ€š happy adventuring.
