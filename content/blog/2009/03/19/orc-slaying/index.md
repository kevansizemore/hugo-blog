Ended up playing my rogue again tonight‚ doing the quest in Hellfire Peninsula where you have to slaughter orcs left and right to get prayer beads. Didn't feel up to playing for very long‚ a lot going on IRL at the moment. Perhaps Friday I will get some decent play time logged.

I did update my WoW screenshot gallery; I will try to get some EQII and Vanguard screenshots put together for your viewing pleasure. Feel free to use my screenshots; I am a great proponent of open/free content.

Lastly‚ I worked with yet another Microsoft support rep in an effort to close my old Windows Live ID. I have low expectations but I hope that this person gets it right. Another email; another day of waiting.

Good night, adventurers.
