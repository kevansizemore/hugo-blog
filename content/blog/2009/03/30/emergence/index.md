It's officialâ€š vacation is over and it's back to work! Fortunately, it also means I'm back to gaming as well. Kicked off the week with some wholesome EverQuest II adventuring. I have a Froglok Dirge and a Ratonga Brigand (read: a frog and a rat that run around with sharp, pointy objects).

Time to get a bit of sleep before work.
