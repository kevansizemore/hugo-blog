I took this photo in September of 2011 from atop Mount Washington overlooking Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  I rode the historic Duquesne Incline to this vantage point - definitely something worth experiencing if you're in the area.

This is perhaps one of my best-known photographs.  I took several photos of Pittsburgh this particular evening and one of them was published in the Princeton Photography Club's 2011 Year in Review (see pages 150-151):
