55. have sufficient experience as a nerd to compose a 55-item list of typical characteristics.

This is all in fun and in the interest of transparency, I've probably done (and may still be doing) most of them.

If you'd like to share the fun with others, try this:

- Make a copy of this list for each person and pass it around
- Have each person claim 1 point per nerd characteristic that's true
- Total & compare scores to see who's most in danger of being labeled a "nerd"

I've probably missed a few things in this list (yes, my opinion is inherently flawed and I don't want to hear about it). Feel free to use any portion or the entirety of this list however you wish. If you do something interesting with it, I would be cool if you let me know about it. :-)

Don't worry, nerd is a *term of endearment* (or at least, that's what I've been told). Enjoy!
