Got a great book entitled [World of Warcraft and Philosophy: Wrath of the Philosopher King](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6663553-world-of-warcraft-and-philosophy) as a gift for Christmas this year.  It's a great read; it's thought provoking and motivational, encouraging me to pursue character creation in WoW with reckless abandon.  My lovely wife and I have been working on our trades skills together which has been a wonderful experience in and out of game.

Hope everyone is enjoying the new year; until next time...
