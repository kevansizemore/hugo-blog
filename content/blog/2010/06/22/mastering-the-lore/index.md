It's sad, really: an obsession with the "old" in a game. I am currently pursuing the "Lore Master" achievement for the classic (original) World of Warcraft content before everything changes in the Cataclysm expansion.

In an unrelated story, I'm now up to 3 level 80 characters (DK, Warrior and Rogue) and counting. Still not sure which character I want to focus on next; probably some flavor of ranged dps.

So, that's what I've been up to.

For the record, I ended up getting an iPad. "Resistance is futile!"

Hope to see you online. Cheers!
