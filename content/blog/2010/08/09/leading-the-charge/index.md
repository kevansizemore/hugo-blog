I'm back in the saddle again it would seem...

I disbanded my old guild on Proudmoore due to inactivity and merged with a new guild, Raiding Legion.  Given my over zealous nature, it didn't take long to get involved with the raiding team and somehow I've managed to acquire the Raid Leader role in addition to web site administration duties. I am very happy to experience Icecrown Citadel raid content, but at the same time it's a lot of work to prepare for and lead a group of 10 into some of the most challenging content World of Warcraft has to offer (for now).

At the same time, it's nice to know I'm not alone. Thanks to the power of Google and YouTube, I can find out everything I never wanted to know about boss encounters and raid strategies. Just like anything else, it's a matter of doing the homework and planning ahead of time. Hopefully this will work out well as I can focus on experiencing end-game content while I continue to grind away at achievements (see previous post).

I hope all is well for anyone that may be reading this.  Until next time, hope to see you online!
