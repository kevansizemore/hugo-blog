Greetings, fans and followers...

Been playing quite a bit of StarCraft II lately with a good friend of mine. This game brings back many fond memories of HOURS wasted in the mid 1990's playing the original StarCraft online via dial-up connection (which makes me sound ancient, I know). It has been reworked to take advantage of modern computers and the AI has proven to be considerably more challenging.

My friend and I got beat down the first time we tried to take on 2v2 or 2v3; in fact we're just starting to win the 2v3 matches (which can be a little rough at first). I don't know if we'll be winning any 1v7 matches soon, but here's hoping. If you enjoy RTS games (e.g., Command & Conquer, Company of Heroes) then I would strongly recommend giving StarCraft II a try.

A quick update on my WoW life...

Blizzard just released patch 4.0.1 in preparation for the Cataclysm expansion. I feel like I'm learning how to play all over again. I find it both frustrating (at first) and refreshing that the World of Warcraft development team relentlessly pursues a better gaming experience. Once you think you've seen and done everything, they make some radical changes that drive up the replay value of the content.

Cataclysm will be released on December 7th and I have already pre-ordered 2 copies. :-)

Happy gaming & I hope to see you online!
