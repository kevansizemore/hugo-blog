From *Connect the Testaments: A One-Year Daily Devotional with Bible Reading Plan* by John D. Barry and Rebecca Van Noord:

> We can never predict how God will use people, and at times we may be shocked by whom He uses. Some people we think are lost may end up being found after all. Let's dream of redemption for those who need it most.

Having experienced life on both sides of redemption, [I'm so glad He found me](https://biblia.com/media/shared/119055). The realization of my need for Him increases evermore.
