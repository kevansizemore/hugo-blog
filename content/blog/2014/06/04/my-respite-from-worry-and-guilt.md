I came across a great quote while reading an interview with Shailene Woodley in *Time* magazine:

> "I've realized that worry is the product of a future we cannot guarantee and guilt is the product of a past we cannot change."

I don't know much about this actress, but I know a good piece of theology when I see one. This is a great reminder of how little control we have in life. Ultimately, the only lasting comfort I've found is in realizing God alone establishes our future and redeems our past. He doesn't have to do it. He wants to do it. Because He loves us. Because He has compassion for us. Because He is eager to be gracious toward us, if we open our hearts to Him.
