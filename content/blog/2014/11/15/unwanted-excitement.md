Well, this isn't the kind of excitement one wants on a Friday night: the adjoining townhouse is on fire.

**Update**: The fire was put out quickly (partly because City of Newport News Fire Fighters are awesome and partly because the fire alarm and sprinkler system worked as intended). The unfortunate side effect of that being I now have some minor water/smoke damage to deal with along the common wall between my neighbor and I. Thank goodness for homeowner's insurance.
