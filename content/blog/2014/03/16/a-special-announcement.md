Miracles happen every day. Seriously.

But do you remember what it's like right before a miracle happens?

It's frustrating. It's painful. Sometimes things cost you more than you wanted to pay. Sometimes you want to give up or entertain the notion that maybe "it just wasn't meant to be." At your lowest points, you feel a degree of resentment or envy.

But despite all that, even when hope wanes, you never stop believing something miraculous could happen.

This has been our journey for over 11 years. 

But the good news is, when a miracle happens, nothing that happened before matters. All the pain, sorrow, frustration, and tears melt away into sheer joy. That's what makes a miracle so divine: its supernatural ability to change the things that hurt us the most into our greatest sources of joy.

Our miracle will arrive in early September of this year. Kimberly and I are thrilled to share that we're expecting a healthy, happy baby!

By the way, if you're still waiting on a miracle, may this be as meaningful to you as it has been to us:

> "For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future." (Jeremiah 29:11 NIV)

Thank you to all the friends and family that have shared in our journey; may you share in the joy of our miracle as well.
