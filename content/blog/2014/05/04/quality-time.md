Quality time with those we love is one of the greatest treasures one can experience in this life (and the life to come). I'm so blessed to call Kimberly my wife and I love to see her smileâ€”it fills my heart with joy. I hope and pray that everyone finds someone they can share a lifetime with; we weren't made to do life alone!
