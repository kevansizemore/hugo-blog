Just in case you haven't heard...

Kimberly and I are proud to announce that George Wyatt Sizemore was born on September 10, 2014 shortly after 9:30am EST. He's approximately 20" long and 8.5 pounds. Friends and family are welcome to contact us and setup a time to visit after this weekend. I'll be creating a private Facebook group once we have some more pictures; if you're interested in seeing more please let me know.
