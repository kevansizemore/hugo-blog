Some collet propeller adapters are perfectly circular and do not have two flat spots you can use to grasp them with a wrench. If youâ€™re having trouble holding onto a collet propeller adapter while threading on a new propeller or removing a broken propeller, take a short strip of the foam rubber that you would wrap around a receiver or other electronics and place it in the jaws of a good set of pliers, then use the padded jaws to grasp the collet propeller adapter. This usually provides an effective grip without the damage caused by using pliers without foam rubber padding.
