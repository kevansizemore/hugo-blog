At the beginning, they spring forth through the miracle of life and growth.

Through the middle, they persist through the storms and the heat, remaining on the branch and nourishing the tree in which they are placed.

Approaching the end, their productive green gradually fades to reveal the vibrant colors of a life well-lived, a final testament to their Creator's splendor.
