I was recently reminded that my long-neglected website (especially the blog) needed some fresh content. Many of the old excuses (e.g., finishing a master's degree, starting a family, finishing theological seminary, moving) have lost their merit. It's time to start cleaning up what remains and begin adding content to the site. I'm unwilling to commit to a particular frequency or volume of content updatesâ€”but I will do better at writing and publishing more consistently going forward.
